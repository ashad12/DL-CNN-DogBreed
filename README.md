# DL-CNN-DogBreed
Dog Breed classifier using CNN costume model vs transfer learning

## Dataset
1- The dataset was provided and is believed to be part of [Kaggle Dog Breed dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification) that contains 8351 dog images

2- 13233 human face images called here as *human_files*

## Steps
The whole idea here is to make a *dog app* that is able to:

- recognize if the given picture is human or a dog

- if a dog is detected then predict its breed.

- if a human face is detected, find a similar dog breed
